# reward-point-2

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every
dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

I think above example calculation is wrong.

According to my logic Above example should evaulate to following Logic :
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$70 = 110 points).

Let me know above is correct.
